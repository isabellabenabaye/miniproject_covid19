# miniproject_covid19

This is a mini project between Bella and Pat which attempts to create analyses of Covid-19 cases in the Philippines that will drive the government and organizations to create relevant policies and programs, and that will raise awareness among the Filipino mass to help support their communities.

Analyses are fluid and might change along the way depending on data availability.
